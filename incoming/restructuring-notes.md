# Restructuring Notes

## New Business Repo

Add a metadata FAQ JSON-LD with one question and one answer.

Question is one that interests your primary audience. The answer is the trigger to get the action you need.

Example required.

## Date Format Problem

What does 5/12/2026 mean to an AI? An American? A European?

Have you ever seen the American reaction to "meet up at 18:00"?

Microdata fix: use ISO format.
