# Book Ideas: Registry, QR Codes, and Cards

## Registry Ownership

The registry requires proof of ownership and authority. Business users must pay 100 per year per card plus a signed account, which is tied to their domain name via a token.

Open-source users must have the token on GitHub or a similar service. Pricing is much cheaper, to encourage use.

Remember data sovereignty.

## QR Codes Everywhere

A QR code on any poster, sign, bus stop, premise, blue plaque or whatever can link to the website to give context or an MX-card for instructions or feedback.

Personalised QR codes for property.

QR codes everywhere.

## The App

We need an app.

An MX card can contain a routine to contact the card owner before responding to the card discoverer.

App has an on-board card with the owner's personal identity layer. The card can stay on the phone or can be shared.

## Card Features

Cards can be time-limited and scheduled. Cards can be encrypted. Plain cards are free. Scheduled, time-limited, and encrypted cards cost more.

Cards can be shared with agents and chatbots. Cards can be encrypted and have authorised tokens with access levels.

## Identity Layer

Machines are robots, phones, cars, and LLMs.

The identity layer is a layer of identity. It contains menu preferences for use with a menu card. It contains allergies, which are inherited from and inform the menu. Etc.
