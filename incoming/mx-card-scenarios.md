# MX-Card Scenarios

## Venues and Restaurants

Recipes. Tables in a restaurant.

As you enter a premise with a beacon that is unknown to your app, and the identity layer allows notifications, the app will ask if you want to enable the MX-card. If you say yes, the identity layer searches your data for a matching set; if not, it downloads the default data from the venue. The user can adjust it to add inheritance or change options.

This way, a museum can offer a default route through the premises. Or a menu of routes.

If the venue charges, then a share of the proceeds goes to the MX-card hosting site.

## Device Integration

A card QR code on a smartwatch, etc., combined with the device identity layer on the phone or laptop, enables the card to install or configure the connection.

## Government and Identity

Governments can create identity layers for individuals, such as social security numbers. Or age verification certificates, which can be added to the individual identity layer with a permission guard.

## Permission Guards

Permission guards can be added to any facet of the identity layer. AI agents are not told why access to a facet is denied. The user can adjust permissions at will, and agents may not even know if an identity layer exists.

## Portability

Identity layers must be portable. Signed secure transfer to a backup. Or to an owner's new phone or laptop. Identity layers can be globally deleted by a signed application.

## Inheritance

An adult can create identity layers for children. Child identity layers can inherit from the parent. Business facets in an identity area can be inherited from the business identity layer — an employee is effectively a child of the business.
