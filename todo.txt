# MX-Gathering Deployment TODO

## Current Status

✅ **COMPLETED:**
- [x] Repository created (public, MIT licensed)
- [x] Content structure established (events, discussions, contributors, members)
- [x] Domain strategy documented
- [x] Landing page created (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
- [x] Branch strategy implemented (main/staging/dev)
- [x] GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows configured
- [x] Development environment documentation complete
- [x] Developer quick start guide published

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Configure Cloudflare Pages (CRITICAL - Do First)

**Purpose:** Enable automated deployments for all environments

**Actions Required:**
1. Go to Cloudflare Pages Dashboard: https://dash.cloudflare.com/
2. Click "Create a project" → "Connect to Git"
3. Select repository: "Digital-Domain-Technologies-Ltd/MX-Gathering"
4. Configure build settings:
   - Framework preset: None (static HTML)
   - Build command: (leave empty)
   - Build output directory: `web`
   - Root directory: (leave empty)
5. Configure branch deployments:
   - Production branch: `main`
   - Preview branches: `staging`, `dev`, `feature/*`
6. Save and deploy

**Expected Result:**
- main branch deploys to auto-generated URL (e.g., mx-gathering.pages.dev)
- staging/dev branches create preview deployments
- Every PR triggers preview deployment

**Documentation Reference:** docs/development/ENVIRONMENTS.md (lines 165-214)

---

### 2. Configure Custom Domains in Cloudflare (CRITICAL - Do Second)

**Purpose:** Connect your purchased domains to deployments

**DNS Records to Add:**

```dns
# Production domain
mx-thegathering.ai
  CNAME @ <cloudflare-pages-url> (Proxied: ON)
  CNAME www <cloudflare-pages-url> (Proxied: ON)

# Staging domain
staging.mx-thegathering.ai
  CNAME staging <cloudflare-staging-url> (Proxied: ON)

# Development domain
dev.mx-thegathering.ai
  CNAME dev <cloudflare-dev-url> (Proxied: ON)
```

**Actions Required:**
1. In Cloudflare Pages project settings, go to "Custom domains"
2. Add custom domain: mx-thegathering.ai
3. Add custom domain: staging.mx-thegathering.ai
4. Add custom domain: dev.mx-thegathering.ai
5. Wait for SSL certificates to provision (5-15 minutes)
6. Verify HTTPS works for all domains

**Documentation Reference:** docs/domains/HOSTING-SETUP.md (lines 66-99)

---

### 3. Enable Branch Protection Rules (REQUIRED - Do Third)

**Purpose:** Enforce PR workflow and prevent direct pushes to protected branches

**Actions Required:**
1. Go to GitHub repository settings:
   https://github.com/Digital-Domain-Technologies-Ltd/MX-Gathering/settings/branches
2. Add branch protection rule for `main`:
   - [x] Require a pull request before merging
   - [x] Require approvals (at least 1)
   - [x] Require status checks to pass before merging
     - Select: validate-html, check-links, accessibility, lighthouse
   - [x] Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - [x] Include administrators (recommended)
3. Add branch protection rule for `staging`:
   - [x] Require a pull request before merging
   - [x] Require status checks to pass before merging
     - Select: validate-html, check-links, accessibility, lighthouse
4. Add branch protection rule for `dev`:
   - [x] Require status checks to pass before merging
     - Select: validate-html, check-links, accessibility, lighthouse

**Expected Result:**
- Direct pushes to main/staging blocked
- All changes must go through PR review
- Automated tests must pass before merge
- History remains clean and auditable

**Documentation Reference:** docs/development/ENVIRONMENTS.md (lines 105-154)

---

### 4. Configure Secondary Domain Redirects (OPTIONAL - Do Later)

**Purpose:** Redirect secondary domains to primary or specific paths

**Options Available:**

**Option A: All domains → Primary (simplest)**
Redirect everything to mx-thegathering.ai

**Option B: Subdirectory mapping (recommended)**
- mx-thegathering.net → mx-thegathering.ai/docs
- mx-thegathering.info → mx-thegathering.ai/learn
- mx-thegathering.store → mx-thegathering.ai/store
- mx-thegathering.xyz → mx-thegathering.ai/labs

**Option C: Independent sites**
Each domain hosts separate content

**Actions Required:**
1. Decide on redirect strategy
2. Configure Cloudflare Page Rules (if redirecting)
3. Add DNS records for secondary domains
4. Test all redirects

**Documentation Reference:** docs/domains/DOMAIN-STRATEGY.md (lines 191-249)

---

### 5. Test Deployment Pipeline (VERIFICATION - Do Fourth)

**Purpose:** Verify entire workflow works end-to-end

**Test Checklist:**

**A. Test Feature Branch Workflow:**
```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b feature/test-deployment
echo "<p>Test deployment</p>" >> web/index.html
git add web/index.html
git commit -m "test: verify deployment pipeline"
git push origin feature/test-deployment
```
- [ ] GitHub Actions PR checks run automatically
- [ ] Cloudflare creates preview deployment
- [ ] Preview URL is accessible
- [ ] HTML validates
- [ ] Accessibility passes
- [ ] Performance meets thresholds

**B. Test PR Merge to Dev:**
- [ ] Create PR from feature/test-deployment to dev
- [ ] Verify status checks appear in PR
- [ ] Merge PR after checks pass
- [ ] Verify dev.mx-thegathering.ai updates

**C. Test Staging Promotion:**
- [ ] Create PR from dev to staging
- [ ] Merge after checks pass
- [ ] Verify staging.mx-thegathering.ai updates

**D. Test Production Deployment:**
- [ ] Create PR from staging to main
- [ ] Request review (if required)
- [ ] Merge after approval and checks
- [ ] Verify mx-thegathering.ai updates

---

### 6. Configure Monitoring and Alerts (OPTIONAL - Do Later)

**Purpose:** Track uptime, performance, and errors

**Recommended Tools:**

**A. Uptime Monitoring:**
- Service: UptimeRobot (free tier)
- URL: https://uptimerobot.com/
- Monitor: mx-thegathering.ai (5-minute checks)
- Alert: tom.cranstoun@gmail.com

**B. Performance Monitoring:**
- Use Cloudflare Web Analytics (free)
- Enable in Cloudflare dashboard
- Track Core Web Vitals

**C. Error Tracking:**
- Review Cloudflare Pages build logs
- Monitor GitHub Actions workflow runs
- Check Cloudflare Analytics for 4xx/5xx errors

**Documentation Reference:** docs/domains/HOSTING-SETUP.md (lines 307-332)

## Notes

- **Develop in the open:** All changes are public and transparent
- **Branch strategy:** feature/* → dev → staging → main (production)
- **Automated testing:** Every PR runs HTML validation, accessibility, performance
- **Preview deployments:** Every feature branch gets automatic preview URL
- **No build process:** Plain HTML/CSS/JS deploys directly

### AI Assistant Side Notice (24/Jan/2026)

During HTML validation work comparing web pages against Appendix D (AI-Friendly HTML Guide), discovered three patterns implemented in index.html and about.html that were not yet documented in Appendix D:

1. **Heading anchor IDs for deep linking** - H2-H6 elements with id attributes derived from heading text (e.g., `<h2 id="what-is-machine-experience">`)
2. **External CSS separation** - Inline styles extracted to shared-gathering.css for better caching and maintainability
3. **Social media card meta tags with accessibility** - twitter:image:alt attributes providing alt text for social media preview images

These patterns are production-ready in the MX-Gathering web pages and should be documented in Appendix D for future reference. Implementation complete; documentation pending.
