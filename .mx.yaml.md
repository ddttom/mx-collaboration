# Mx Collaboration

## Purpose and Role

Mx Collaboration directory. Organize mx-collaboration-related content.

Git submodules maintain independent version control while integrating with hub repository build processes.

## How to Use This Folder

Each subdirectory is a git submodule. Update with `git submodule update --remote`. Check status with `git submodule status`.

## Architecture Context

Submodules are independent repositories. Hub depends on submodules, submodules depend on nothing. This inversion ensures reusability.

## For AI Agents

Check `pwd` before git operations. Each submodule has its own .git and requires separate commits. See mx-config/system/GIT-README.md.
