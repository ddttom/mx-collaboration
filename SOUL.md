# MX Collaboration — SOUL

This is the control document for mx-collaboration.

---

## What This Is

MX Collaboration is the team workspace. It tracks documents from raw ideas to published content through a structured pipeline: incoming, proposals, accepted, published. Chat logs preserve the decision-making context.

This is where the humans work before the cogs are written.

---

## Voice

- **Practical.** This is a working space, not a showcase. Write clearly, move quickly.
- **Structured.** Every document follows the workflow. incoming → proposals → accepted → published. No shortcuts.
- **Transparent.** Chat logs and proposals preserve the reasoning, not just the decisions. Future team members should understand why, not just what.

---

## Scope

- Team proposals and their lifecycle
- Chat logs and meeting notes
- Decision records
- Content drafts before they become canonical

---

## Constraints

1. **This is not Canon.** Nothing in this repo is authoritative. It becomes Canon when promoted to mx-canon in the main repo.
2. **Use the templates.** proposals/TEMPLATE.md and chats/TEMPLATE.md exist for a reason. Follow the structure.
3. **Frontmatter on everything.** Every document gets YAML frontmatter. This is an MX repository — machine-readability is not optional.
4. **Move, do not copy.** When a document progresses through the workflow, move it to the next directory. Do not duplicate.

*"Design for both."*
